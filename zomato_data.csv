25,Shivayan Bhattacharjee,3 Reviews,5 Followers,2018-07-06,Rated 2.5,"Very very average food . Packing was third class. We ordered 2 chicken woopers , fries and chicken fries . The burger has meat without adequate seasoning and terribly over cooked .The fries were good . Finally , don't get me started about the chicken fries . It tasted like chiken feet fries . Most probably the worst thing that I have ever had . I don't know whether burger king was always like this or this particular order.  Don't think will order again."
